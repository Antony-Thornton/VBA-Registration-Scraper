# VBA-Registration-Scraper
I built a Macro that takes registrations, enters them into the DVLA website and pulls out publicly available information associated with that vehicle.


## Business Case
A team in the business needed to collect data on vehicles from the government website in order to ensure our records matched. This involved scraping the data of dozens of vehicles each week. 

## Solution
The macro I created would loop through a list of registrations. Navigate to the website, extract the data and put it into a spreadsheet. The team could then compare this data to ours in the system. 

## Outcome
The macro saved approximately 3 minutes per vehicle each week and allowed other tasks to be completed while the macro collected this information for them.

### Future enhancements
Potentially achievable via python scripting. May avoid having to open and close new internet explorer windows.
